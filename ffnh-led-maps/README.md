 ffnh-led-maps

Drop-in LED mapping files (vendor-/model-specific allow-lists) for the LED Config Mode Wizard.

## Purpose
- Provide per-device/per-vendor **allow-lists** of colors or full sysfs LED names.
- Keep the Wizard generic: if no map matches, it falls back to **automatic sysfs detection**.
